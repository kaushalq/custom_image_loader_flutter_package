## Features

- Customizable size for both the loader and the image.
- Ability to specify the duration of the rotation.
- Smooth transition animations using `CurvedAnimation`.
- Supports any image provider, allowing the use of assets, network images, etc.
- The loader rotates around the image without cutting it off.
